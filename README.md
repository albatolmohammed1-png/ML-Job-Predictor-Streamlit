# ML-Job-Predictor-Streamlit

This project predicts the likelihood of a fresh graduate receiving a job offer based on their profile attributes.
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

ðŸ”— Job Fair Candidates Dataset â€“ Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarekmuhammed/job-fair-candidates)

The analysis includes:
 â€¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing (scaling & encoding)
 â€¢ Training and comparison of four models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and MLPClassifier
 â€¢ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
 â€¢ Model deployment as a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions

Key Findings:
The MLPClassifier achieved the best balance between recall and accuracy, making it the most effective model for predicting job offer likelihood.
